	<details>
		<summary>My chidhood</summary>
		<p>I was born and brought up in Udupi a coastal town of Karnataka. I have done my schooling in Milagres English Medium School Kallianpur Udupi. Later I have completed my pre university education in Vidyodaya Pre-university College Udupi. In my childhood I was very passionate about dancing. So I joined dance classes. I learnt both classical as well as western dancing. In my childhood I used to play a lot. And now as I have grown up I miss my childhood. I miss all the fun I had. But neverthless I am happy now, because I am going to keep all the childhood memories with me forever.</p></details>
